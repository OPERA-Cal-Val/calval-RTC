    "# OPERA RTC Validation: Cross Correlation-based Relative Geolocation of a Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eric Lundell & Franz J Meyer; Alaska Satellite Facility, University of Alaska Fairbanks**\n",
    " \n",
    "** This notebook is best ran on a machine that can handle 120 GB RAM and 32 CPUs **\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the relative geolocation quality of OPERA RTC products using cross-correlation of images in a stack. The notebook assumes that a stack of RTC scenes have been created and put into the `./work/original/` directory (possibly through the accompanying `1b_get_prepared_data_from_s3` notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once imports are imported, Dask is initialized (section 0), and VVs are selected (section 1), the rest of the notebook can be run automatically. Once a section is run, a sequential section can be reran independently. This can reduce the non-linear aspects of notebooks and also allow for more playing with code.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The following procedures will be applied in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select VV tiffs from prepared stack. Any `*_vv.tif` within the selected directory or child directories will be copied. Move tiffs to `./.work/original/`.\n",
    "1. Superset tiffs to a common AOI and save re-formatted tiffs in `./work/superset/`.\n",
    "1. Due to spikes in data, flatten the tiffs by chopping off the bottom 1% and top 1%. Save tiffs in `./work/flatten/`.\n",
    "1. Because of NaNs and other areas of no-data, evenly tile the tiffs (default to 8x8). To speed things up, we use a Dask LocalCluster to multiprocess. Tiles are saved in `./work/tiles/`.\n",
    "1. Apply the cross-correlation function to the individual tile nearest-chronological pairs. If more than 10% of a tile is NaNs, treat the whole tile as a NaN. Any remaining NaNs are converted to zero. Data is upscaled by a factor of ten. The cross correlation results include the shift in x and y and the RMSE. Results are converted from degrees to meters. The results are saved as json files for each tile pair in `./work/correlation/`.\n",
    "1. Perform analysis on json results. Results are read into a Pandas DataFrame. A statistical description and graph of the results are shown in two ways: all tiles in a scene are averaged and all tiles are averaged in time. "
